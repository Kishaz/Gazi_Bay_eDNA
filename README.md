# Gazi_Bay_eDNA
Assessing fish diversity in heterogeneous Gazi Bay seascape. A focus on the sea-grass meadows. We sampled three sites within the bay that have characteristic habitat features interlinked (Seagrass, mangrove and coral reef). This work complements the traditional fish survey techniques (catch assessment and Underwater visualization). In our study, eDNA outperformed the conventional techniques with 23 extra species and gives perspective of the presence of fish species not regularly caught by fishers. 
We do note that most fish species in the study site and by extension the region have not been barcoded (12S mtDNA region) which poses a limitation interms of taxonomic classification.
